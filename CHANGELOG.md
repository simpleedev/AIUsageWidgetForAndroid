# Changelog

All notable changes to AI Usage Widget are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Released APKs are attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/john-gitdev/AIUsageWidgetForAndroid/releases).

**From 1.0.9 on, releases install over each other normally.** They are signed with a
stable release key, so updating is just a matter of installing the new APK.

**Upgrading from 1.0.8 or earlier needs one uninstall.** Every release up to and
including 1.0.8 was debug-signed, and because each CI run generated a throwaway debug
key, *no two of those releases shared a certificate*. Android keys upgrades off the
signing certificate, so installing 1.0.9 over an older build fails until the old copy is
removed. Uninstalling clears app data, so you will need to sign in to Claude and ChatGPT
again — once.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-10-05

### Changed
- **Reset countdowns omit zero hours when less than an hour remains.** Claude session and
  weekly countdowns now show `Resets in 25m` instead of `Resets in 0h 25m`, matching ChatGPT.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- **Claude fresh sessions no longer show `Unknown` just because `resets_at` is omitted.** If the
  Claude usage response explicitly contains a session limit at 0% used and weekly quota remains,
  the session row now shows `Ready` even when Claude does not provide a session reset timestamp.
- **The same explicit-window rule is used for ChatGPT.** A present 0%-used primary window is
  `Ready`; a genuinely absent/indeterminate session window is not silently treated as ready.
- **Notification reset time remains honest when the timestamp is missing.** If the widget is
  `Ready` but the service did not supply a reset timestamp, the notification's `Next Reset` value
  is `Unknown` rather than inventing a time.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-09-29

### Changed
- **Weekly exhaustion now controls the session reset display.** For both Claude and ChatGPT, when
  weekly usage reaches 100%, the session reset row mirrors the weekly reset countdown/timestamp
  instead of showing an otherwise-irrelevant session-window reset. This keeps both rows focused on
  the next reset that can actually restore usable quota.
- **`Ready` still applies only while weekly quota remains.** With weekly capacity available, a fresh
  0%-used session continues to show `Ready`; genuine `Unknown` and `Error` states remain unchanged.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-09-29

### Changed
- **Fresh unused session windows now show `Ready`.** For both Claude and ChatGPT, when session
  usage is 0%, weekly quota is still available, and the service supplied a valid session reset,
  the session reset row shows `Ready` instead of a countdown such as `Resets in 4h 59m`.
- **Unknown and error states stay explicit.** A missing or unparseable reset remains `Unknown`
  rather than being converted to `Ready`. Failed refreshes show `Error`, clear stale reset
  timestamps, and quota notifications show `Next Reset: Error` or `Next Reset: Unknown` instead
  of continuing to display an old reset time.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-09-28

### Changed
- **Quota notifications now show the next relevant reset in the title** instead of the last refresh time.
  If weekly quota is exhausted (100% used), the title shows the weekly reset; otherwise it shows
  the session reset. Same-day resets show only the local time, while later resets show the abbreviated weekday before the time (for example `Tue 3:45 PM`).
- **Reset timestamps are saved directly from each service response** so notification reset times remain
  exact instead of being reconstructed from relative strings such as `Resets in 4h 12m`. Enabled
  notifications automatically request one refresh after upgrading from older saved data.
- **Refresh when screen turns on uses a neutral gray checkmark** instead of the green checked state.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- **Shared Settings tab.** The former Log tab is now a Settings tab containing the shared
  auto-refresh interval, widget tap action, screen-on refresh option, and the View Log button.
- **Optional refresh when the screen turns on.** When enabled, the app dynamically listens for
  screen-on events while Android keeps the app process alive and triggers the same one-shot refresh
  used by manual refresh. A two-minute cooldown avoids redundant wake refreshes after a recent
  successful update.

### Changed
- **Notification timestamps moved into the title**, for example
  `Claude Quota - Refreshed: 10:26 AM`.
- **Notification opt-ins are service-specific in the UI.** The Claude tab shows only the Claude
  ongoing-notification checkbox; the ChatGPT tab shows only the ChatGPT checkbox.
- **Tapping a quota notification now opens the app on that service's tab.** Refreshing remains an
  explicit **Refresh** notification action.
- **Auto refresh is now clearly shared by widgets and enabled notifications.** Both are updated by
  the same WorkManager refresh worker.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-09-28

### Changed
- **Ongoing notifications are now an explicit Settings opt-in.** The Settings screen shows
  separate Claude and ChatGPT checkboxes at the same time. Both default to off; unchecking one
  immediately removes that service's notification, and denying Android's notification permission
  leaves the checkbox off.
- **Manual GitHub Actions builds now upload the signed release APK as an artifact.** This gives
  test builds the same release signature as installed 1.0.9+ versions, avoiding Android's
  "package conflicts with an existing package" error caused by installing a locally debug-signed APK.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- **Optional ongoing quota notifications for Claude and ChatGPT.** Each service has its own
  setting and its own low-priority notification showing the same session/weekly usage and
  reset information as the widget. Tapping the notification or its **Refresh** action runs
  a manual refresh. On Android versions that allow ongoing notifications to be swiped away,
  an enabled notification posts itself again after dismissal.

### Fixed
- **Manual refresh no longer gets stuck behind Android's network state after Wi-Fi → mobile
  handoff.** Manual taps now start the worker immediately and let the actual HTTP request use
  the current default network. Periodic work still requires a connected network. A real
  handoff failure still keeps the last readings and uses the existing retry/backoff path.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-22

### Changed
- **New app icon:** an hourglass with "AI" across it, on a navy background. The artwork
  is centered on the hourglass itself, so it sits in the middle of the launcher's circle or
  rounded-square mask; the old gauge icon rode low. Themed (monochrome) icons on Android 13+
  get a matching single-color hourglass.

### Fixed
- **Widgets no longer show "Error" when the connection drops for a moment**, such as
  moving from Wi-Fi to mobile data. Refreshes used to run with or without a connection, so
  a run that landed mid-handover failed with `UnknownHostException` and replaced the
  readings with "Error" until the next refresh. Now:
  - Refreshes wait for a working connection before they run.
  - If the server still can't be reached, the refresh is retried a few times with backoff
    (15 s, 30 s, 60 s).
  - After that, the widget keeps its last readings and shows `Offline · 5:35 PM` (the time
    those readings are from). "Error" appears only if there were no readings to keep.
  - Tapping refresh with no connection shows "Waiting for network..." and refreshes by
    itself once the connection is back. Repeated taps no longer queue up extra refreshes.
  - The log records retries as warnings, and gives up with an error after the last try.
- **ChatGPT no longer says "Session expired" when the connection drops while it's
  renewing its access token.** A network failure there is now handled like any other
  offline refresh.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-09-22

### Changed
- **Releases are signed with a stable release key**, so from this version on updates
  install over each other without uninstalling. Builds are now `assembleRelease` rather
  than `assembleDebug`, and CI verifies the signing certificate against a pinned
  fingerprint before publishing, so a lost or swapped keystore fails the build instead of
  shipping a release that silently orphans every install.
- **Application ID moved from `com.example.claudewidget` to `dev.johngitdev.aiusagewidget`.**
  `com.example.*` is a placeholder namespace that app stores reject. This was done in the
  same version as the signing change so that both would cost only the single uninstall
  that the signing change already required.

### Upgrading
Uninstall any earlier version first, then install this one. Your home screen widgets will
need to be added again, and you will need to log in to Claude and ChatGPT once more.
Updates after this one will not need any of that.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- **In-app log.** Refresh results, HTTP errors (status plus the start of the error
  body, which reveals things like a Cloudflare challenge page) and login events are
  appended to `files/app_log.txt`, capped at 128 KB. Open it with **Log** in the tab
  bar to read it newest-first, with Copy and Clear. Cookies, tokens and the bodies of
  successful responses are never written to it.

### Changed
- **One login browser per service.** Claude and ChatGPT each get their own WebView,
  Google sign-in popup and login poller, tied to the service rather than to whichever
  tab is open. Switching tabs only changes which browser is visible, so a half-finished
  login is still there when you come back. Once a login is detected that browser loads
  `about:blank`, so the site's scripts stop running in the background.
- **"Log out completely" is now scoped to the current service.** The other service stays
  signed in, since its widget and tab read the session saved in preferences.
- Widgets open the app through `MainActivity.openTabIntent()`
  (`NEW_TASK | CLEAR_TOP | SINGLE_TOP`), so an already-running app switches tabs via
  `onNewIntent` instead of just coming to the front.

### Fixed
- **Re-login left the old ChatGPT session in place.** Deleting a `__Secure-` or `__Host-`
  prefixed cookie (such as `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`) requires the `Secure`
  attribute; without it the browser silently ignored the deletion. Expiry strings now
  include it.
- **Widgets opened the wrong tab.** The Claude widget never said which tab to open, and
  because it sent a plain launcher intent a running app simply came to the front.
- The success screen claimed "Connected!" even when the last refresh had failed. It now
  reports the failure, for example "Claude Session Expired".

## [1.0.7] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- **Show Usage As** setting — display how much you have used, or how much is left.
- Option to link **Show Usage As** across Claude and ChatGPT so both widgets match.

### Changed
- Refresh state is kept in sync between the app and its widgets.

> **Note on versioning.** An intermediate commit briefly set the version to `1.1.0`
> before it was walked back to `1.0.7`. That number was never tagged or released, so no
> build was ever published as 1.1.0. Both commits shared `versionCode` 10; only the
> 1.0.7 build shipped with it.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- **ChatGPT widget**, alongside the existing Claude widget.
- Tabbed in-app UI to switch between the two services, each with its own login flow.

### Changed
- Project renamed to **AI Usage Widget** to reflect multi-service support.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-09-21

### Changed
- The Google session is cached on re-login, so signing back in is a single tap.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- Google login now works by supporting multiple windows (the sign-in popup) and polling
  for the session cookie, which single-page apps do not surface synchronously.

### Added
- Privacy & Security section in the README.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- Revamped the 4x2 wide widget layout.

### Fixed
- Widget resize detection.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- Larger text throughout the widget; all widget text is now white.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- Configurable widget tap action.

## [1.0] - 2026-09-11
